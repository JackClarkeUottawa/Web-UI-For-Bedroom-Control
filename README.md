# Web-UI-For-Bedroom-Control
This app will eventually be the main user interface for my raspberry pi bedroom control and monitoring system. 


Build instructions:

Python Module: will need to install flask using 'pip install flask'. Then just run the main.py and the raspberry pi server is up and running. You could also use the venv and run bin/python main.py

NodeJS/nextJS module: to run the production build run 'npm run build' in the my-app folder, and 'npm run start' to start the app.
For development, you can run npm run dev to start the development server.
