# Web-UI-For-Bedroom-Control
This app will eventually be the main user interface for my raspberry pi bedroom control and monitoring system. 


Build instructions:

Python Module: will need to install flask using 'pip install flask'. Then just run the main.py and the raspberry pi server is up and running

NodeJS/nextJS module: to run the production build run 'npm run build' in the my-app folder, and 'npm run start' to start the app.
For development, you can run npm run dev to start the development server.
