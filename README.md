# Web-UI-For-Bedroom-Control
This app will eventually be the main user interface for my raspberry pi bedroom control and monitoring system. Lots of extra information is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/JackClarkeUottawa/Web-UI-For-Bedroom-Control/wiki)


install and run instructions:

1. Install flask 'pip install flask
2. run main.py
* its very important that the python server is started first since the webpage does not error handle very well(yet)
3. npm install in the my-app folder
4. if build was successful: npm run start otherwise npm run dev or npm run build



Python Module: will need to install flask using 'pip install flask'. Then just run the main.py and the raspberry pi server is up and running. There is a venv in the repo, however it most likely won't work with your computer. You might need to delete this folder and make a new venv. 

NodeJS/nextJS module: The command to install the folder is 'npm install'. Next you can run the dev server by typing 'npm run dev' or start the build server by typing 'npm run start'
